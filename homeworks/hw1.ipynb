The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health and we have made these data available to you via the DS 100 repository. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through the various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this.

This time, rather than opening up the files manually, let's use Python to print out the first 5 lines of each. The `ds100_utils` library has a method called `head` that will allow you to retrieve the first N lines of a file as a list. For example `ds100_utils.head('data/legend.csv', 5)` will return the first 5 lines of \"data/legend.csv\". Try using this function to print out the first 5 lines of all four files that we just extracted from the zipfile."

    "Missing zip codes aren't our only problem. There is also some bad data where the postal code got messed up, e.g., there are 3 'Ca' and 3 'CA' values. Additionally, there are some extended postal codes that are 9 digits long, rather than the typical 5 digits.\n",

    "Let's look more closely at businesses with missing zip codes. We'll see that many zip codes are missing for a good reason. Examine the businesses with missing zipcode values.  Pay attention to their addresses.  Do you notice anything interesting? You might need to look at a bunch of entries, i.e. don't just look at the first five.\n",

How many occurrences of each value is in the DataFrame? What are the implications for further analysis?

Specifically, create a series in `scoreCts` where the index is the score and the value is the number of times that score was given.\n",
